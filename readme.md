# Telekom test

This is my small application for my telekom application.

The backend was written in Laravel 11.x, and the frontend was developed using Vue 3.x.

I also left some notes in the code (comments starting with `// NOTE:`). These mark points where I would have made different decisions in the development that would not have been bound by the assignment.
