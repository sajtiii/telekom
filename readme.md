# Telekom test
This is my small application for my telekom application.

## 1. part (Questions):


## 2. part (Practical exercise):
The backend was written in Laravel 10.x, and the frontend was developed using Vue 3.x.

I also left some notes in the code (comments starting with `// NOTE:`). These mark points where I would have made different decisions in the development that would not have been bound by the assignment.

Some basic github actions were also added to the software stack.
